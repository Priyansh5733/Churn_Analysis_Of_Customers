** Customer Analytics & Cohort Analysis Project
**
 Project Description
This project focuses on **advanced customer analytics** using SQL to analyze customer behavior, retention, and segmentation patterns.  
The goal of the project is to derive **actionable business insights** by applying real-world analytical techniques such as **cohort analysis, customer segmentation, and retention measurement**.

This project is designed to reflect **industry-level data analyst skills**, rather than basic or exploratory queries.


 Objectives
- Segment customers based on behavior and activity
- Perform cohort analysis to track customer retention over time
- Analyze customer lifecycle and churn patterns
- Measure customer retention and engagement
- Translate raw data into meaningful business insights


Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible)
- Advanced SQL queries
- Window functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

 Project Files
The project consists of the following SQL scripts:

- `1_customersegmentation.sql`  
  Performs customer segmentation based on activity, frequency, or value.

- `2_cohort_analysis.sql`  
  Creates customer cohorts using first purchase or first activity date and analyzes behavior over time.

- `3_customer_retention.sql`  
  Measures customer retention and identifies churned vs active customers.


 SQL Concepts Used
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions:
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`
  - `RANK()`
  - `DENSE_RANK()`
  - `LAG()`
  - `AVG() OVER()`
- Date functions:
  - `DATE_TRUNC`
  - `EXTRACT`
- Conditional aggregation
- Grouping and filtering
- Subqueries and joins

 Key Metrics Generated
